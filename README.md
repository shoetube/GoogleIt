GoogleIt is a simple application that launches a browser and searches Google for the arguments given.
The program requires two modules: sys and webbrowser.
To get the best benefit of the program on Linux, either the file itself or a symbolic link needs to be added to the usr/bin directory. 
This will require root access.
Once the file has been added to the usr/bin directory, the program can be run from anywhere in the file system.
